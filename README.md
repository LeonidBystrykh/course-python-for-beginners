# course-python-for-beginners
Beginners level for biology students
This site is a few days old. I am the beginner in GitHub myself
The course contains minimal introductions to the python language. So far only few chapters are uploaded.
The expected read order is:
1. Variables and functions
2. Lists_n_loops
