# course-python-for-beginners
Beginners level for biology students. 
I am the beginner in GitHub myself.
It will take me some time to build up something systematic and orderly.
Right now it is an eclectic collection of some scripts randomly illustrating some elements of my course.

Numbered chapters are intended for absolute beginners. Further, I added rather randompy choosen subjects. Anyone can check those unordered files depending which title sounds more interesting for you.
