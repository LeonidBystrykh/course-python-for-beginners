# Curve fit scripts
Python for biology students, beginners level

So far I uploaded two scripts, line_fit.ipynb and fit_by_function.ipynb. Both deal with testing real data on coronavirus pandemy in the Netherlands.
Students can further practice improving either of those scripts or make their own based on other fit functions
