# course-python-for-beginners
Beginners level for biology students. 
I am the beginner in GitHub myself.
It will take me some time to build up something systematic and orderly.
Right now it is an eclectic collection of some scripts randomly illustrating some elements of my course.

An order of uploads is:
1. Variables_n_Functions
2. Lists_n_loops
3. Barchart_and_better_options added to slow down excessive use of the barcharts by student
4. Boxplot from array and list. Unexpected behaviour when data type changes
5. Interactive dots. Example of using jupyter widgets. This is a sudden turn into much later chapters on some scripts with tedious parameters optimisation lines. The interactive option can help.
